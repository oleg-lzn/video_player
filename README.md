# 🎬 Video Trimmer with Thumbnails

This is a simple **React-based video trimming tool** that displays a video timeline with frame thumbnails and allows users to select a start and end point for trimming.

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **React**  
  Used as the core UI framework for component-based architecture and reactive state updates.

- **HTML5 Video API**  
  Utilized via a `<video>` element and accessed through `ref` to load, play, and extract metadata from the video.

- **Canvas API**  
  Used in `captureFramesFromVideo` to extract thumbnails from a hidden video element for frame previews.

- **Inline CSS**  
  Styling is handled directly with style objects in JSX for maximum control during rapid prototyping. You can refactor this to CSS Modules or Tailwind later.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 📼 Loads a video (currently hardcoded via `video_example_2.mp4`).
- 🖼 Extracts thumbnails from the video using a canvas and renders them below the video.
- 🟧 Allows users to trim the video via draggable start and end markers.
- ⬛ Displays the current playback position as a thin white line.
- 🟠 Highlights the selected trim region with an orange rectangle (all sides: top, bottom, left, right).
- 🕐 Displays start and end timestamps above the trim area.

---

## 📁 Current Limitations

- The video is hardcoded. You cannot upload or select other video files yet.
- There is no export or actual video cutting – the functionality is UI-only for now.

---

## 🧩 Possible Enhancements

- 🔼 Add file upload functionality.
- 🧠 Integrate with libraries like [Vidstack](https://www.vidstack.io/) or [`ffmpeg.wasm`](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) for real trimming and export.
- 🎛 Add controls for zooming on timeline or previewing frame-by-frame.
- 💅 Use a styling system like Tailwind, CSS Modules or Styled Components.

---

## 📂 File Structure

- `VideoPlayer.jsx` – Main component, controls video and passes state.
- `TrimBar.jsx` – The trimming UI with thumbnails and trim handles.
- `captureFramesFromVideo.js` – Utility to generate preview images from video.

1. Clone the repo
2. Place your own video in `/assets` or modify the `video_example_2` import
